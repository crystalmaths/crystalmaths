Use Case 1: Over_worked_grad_student is a graduate student studying some crystals using HRTEM. They have gorgeous images and now they need to index them for publication to prove that they are making what they think they are making.  

* Over_worked_grad_student will use this software to specify a path to their HRTEM image or images.
* Over_worked_grad_student will use this software to generate an FFT of their image
* Over_worked_grad_student will use the user interface to select planes and set the scale of their image
* Over_worked_grad_student will use this software to calculate the angles between planes in their FFT
* Over_worked_grad_student will use this software to calculate the d spacing of each plane in their FFT
* Over_worked_grad_student will use this software to query the American Mineral Society database to retrieve structures that might match their crystal
* Over_worked_grad_student will use this software to calculate the angles between planes based on the American Mineral Society database information and verify that they have a good match
* Over_worked_grad_student will use this software to calculate the zone axis based on the best match
* Over_worked_grad_student will use this software to generate a plot of their FFT with an indexed zone axis

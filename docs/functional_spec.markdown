**Use Case 1**: <font text=blue>Over_worked_grad_student</font> is a graduate student studying some crystals using HRTEM. They have gorgeous images and now they need to index them for publication to prove that they are making what they think they are making.  

* <font text=blue>Over_worked_grad_student</font> will use this software to specify a path to their HRTEM image or images.
* <font text=blue>Over_worked_grad_student</font> will use this software to generate an FFT of their image.
* <font text=blue>Over_worked_grad_student</font> will use the user interface to select planes and set the scale of their image.
* <font text=blue>Over_worked_grad_student</font> will use this software to calculate the angles between planes in their FFT.
* <font text=blue>Over_worked_grad_student</font> will use this software to calculate the d spacing of each plane in their FFT.
* <font text=blue>Over_worked_grad_student</font> will use this software to query the American Mineral Society database to retrieve structures that might match their crystal.
* <font text=blue>Over_worked_grad_student</font> will use this software to calculate the angles between planes based on the American Mineral Society database information and verify that they have a good match.
* <font text=blue>Over_worked_grad_student</font> will use this software to calculate the zone axis based on the best match.
* <font text=blue>Over_worked_grad_student</font> will use this software to generate a plot of their FFT with an indexed zone axis.
